.. note::

  * Because tcmalloc must be linked as an object library (:code:`alwayslink` in bazel) it is require to use at least CMake 3.21. 
    See the corresponding note on `<https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_libraries.html#linking-object-libraries-via-target-objects>`__
  * Because tcmalloc requires at least C++17 and because it depends on `abseil <https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp>`__, it is important to make sure that abseil is also built with C++17.
    Otherwise you may get link time errors related to :code:`std::basic_string_view`.
    The easiest way to achieve this is to use a :code:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` that sets :code:`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` to :code:`17` or higher.
